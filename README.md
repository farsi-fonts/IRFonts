IRFonts (fonts-ir) are a set of standardized Persian/Arabic fonts initially sponsered by the Supreme Council of ICT of Iran (SCICT) and designed by Hossein Zahedi in 2013.

The Information Technology Organization of Iran (ito.gov.ir) has acquired the fonts and has issued an Open Font Licence (OFL) in 2022.
